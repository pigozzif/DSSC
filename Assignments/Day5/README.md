## Compile
The code can be compiled by typing `make`, and an executable named `cuda_transpose.x` will be created. In addition, the script `script.sh` contains bash code that you can launch with `qsub` (provided it is equipped with accelerators) and it will run all the tests of this assignment in sequence.
