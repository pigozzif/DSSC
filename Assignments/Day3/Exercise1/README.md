## Exercise 1
A program as required in the exercise has been implemented. It can be compiled by running `script.sh`, which downloads `openmpi` in your current Ulysses environment, compiles the code with `mpicc` and runs an executable named `bcast.x` with `mpirun`.
As requested, it initializes an array of size at least 1 GB (in this case, I chose a a power of 2 slightly bigger than that), sets all its elements to -number_of_procs, and uses a call to `MPI_Bcast` to implement a 1:n pattern of communication to send this buffer from process number 0 to all the others, which will then print out the same element.
