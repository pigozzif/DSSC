## Exercise 2
This program implements the midpoint algorithm for computing an approximation of the mathematical constant pi. The code can be compiled by running `script.sh`, which will also take care of running all the experiments. In particular, the different processes are made to compute a local sum on a number of rectangles which is equal to N/num_procs. Subsequently, these local sums are aggregated through a reduction procedure invoked by the call to MPI_Reduce(...) having the last process as the receiving one (this is a kind of communication pattern known as n:1). Finally, this process sends the output to number 0, which will then print it, an operation which involves a synchronous blocking through MPI_Send(...)/MPI_Recv(...). In the meanwhile, the time taken to perform the approximation and reduce the result is measured. The results are summarized in the following plot, which also includes the OpenMP data from the previous lecture:
